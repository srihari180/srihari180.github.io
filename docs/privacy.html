    <h1>Privacy Policy for GPS Camera</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> November 28, 2025</p>

    <p>Srihari ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by the GPS Camera application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Information you provide:</strong> When you contact us or otherwise provide information, we may collect your name, email address, and any other information you choose to provide.</li>
      <li><strong>Camera access</strong> (android.permission.CAMERA): The App needs access to your device's camera to take photos. We do not store, view, or upload your camera feed to our servers. All camera access is only for capturing images you initiate.</li>
      <li><strong>Location data</strong> (android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION &amp; android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION): The App collects precise location data to stamp it onto the photos you capture. Location data is embedded into the image file (visual stamp and EXIF metadata) and stored on your device. We do not transmit or store your location history on our servers.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage access</strong> (android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES, READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE): The App requires storage permissions to save photos to your device's gallery and to display the thumbnail of the last taken photo. The App only accesses images it has created or images you select from the gallery.</li>
      <li><strong>Automatically collected information:</strong> Usage data, log data, device information, IP address, and analytics data when you visit any web pages or use services associated with the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information collected solely to provide and improve the App's functionality, for example to capture and stamp photos, save images to your device, and respond to support requests. We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal data to outside parties. All processing related to stamping photos and embedding metadata happens locally on your device unless you explicitly choose to share content via third-party services.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Because photos and location information are stored locally on your device, data security depends on your device's protections. We use reasonable administrative and technical safeguards where applicable, but cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes set out in this policy or to comply with legal obligations. Images and metadata saved by the App remain on your device until you delete them.</p>

    <h2>5. Children</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, contact us and we will remove it.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your personal data (for example under GDPR or CCPA). To exercise these rights, contact us at the email below.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Effective date" above will reflect when the policy was last updated. Substantive changes will be posted on this page.</p>
