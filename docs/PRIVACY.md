Privacy Policy for GPS Camera

Last Updated: November 28, 2025

Srihari ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by the GPS Camera application (the "App").

1. Information We Collect

The App requires access to the following to function:

• Camera (android.permission.CAMERA): The App needs access to your device's camera to allow you to take pictures. We do not store, view, or upload your camera feed to our servers. All camera access is for the sole purpose of capturing images as initiated by you.

• Location Data (android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION & android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION): The App collects your precise location data to stamp it onto the photos you capture. This location data is embedded directly into the image file (as a visual stamp and in the EXIF metadata) and is stored on your device. We do not transmit or store your location history on our servers.

• Storage Access (android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES, READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE): The App requires storage permissions to save the photos you take to your device's gallery and to display the thumbnail of the last taken photo. The App only accesses images it has created or images you select from the gallery.

2. How We Use Your Information

The data collected is used exclusively to provide the App's core functionality:

• To capture photos and videos using the device's camera.

• To overlay captured photos with location coordinates, street address, date, and time.

• To save the final edited image directly to your device's storage.

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal data to outside parties. All data processing (like adding stamps to photos) happens locally on your device.

3. Data Security

Since all data (photos and location information) is stored locally on your device, the security of your data is dependent on the security of your device. We do not have access to the photos you take.

4. Children's Privacy

Our App does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
