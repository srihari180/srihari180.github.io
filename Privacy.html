# Privacy Policy for GPS Camera with QR

**Last Updated: December 19, 2025**

Srihari ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by the GPS Camera with QR application (the "App").

This policy is based on the core principle that **your data is yours**. The App is designed to function almost entirely on your device, without collecting or storing your personal information on our servers.

### 1. Information We Collect (and What We Don't)

The App requires access to certain permissions to provide its features. All data processing happens locally on your device.

*   **Camera :**
    The App needs access to your device's camera to its primary function: taking pictures. We **do not** record, store, view, or upload your camera feed. Camera access is only active when you are using the app to capture an image.

*   **Location Data :**
    The App collects your precise location to stamp it onto the photos you capture. This location data is fetched in real-time and used for two purposes:
    1.  To be visually stamped onto the photo.
    2.  To be embedded in the image file's EXIF metadata.
    We **do not** transmit, log, or store your location history on our servers.

*   **Storage Access :**
    The App requires storage permissions to:
    1.  Save the photos you take to your device's gallery.
    2.  Display a thumbnail of the last photo you captured.
    The App only accesses images that it has created or images that you explicitly select from your gallery to view.

*   **Internet :**
    The App requires internet access for two non-essential features:
    1.  **Advertisements:** To display ads via the Google Mobile Ads SDK. This SDK may collect anonymized data to serve relevant ads. For more information, please see Google's Privacy Policy.
    2.  **Address Lookup:** To convert your GPS coordinates into a readable street address using your device's Geocoder service. This request is made from your device directly to the Geocoding service.

### 2. How We Use Your Information

The data collected is used exclusively to provide the App's core functionality, which occurs locally on your device:

*   To capture photos using the device's camera.
*   To overlay captured photos with location coordinates, street address, date, and time.
*   To generate and overlay a QR code if that feature is used.
*   To save the final, stamped image directly to your device's storage.

We **do not** sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal data (photos, location) to outside parties.

### 3. Advertising

The App uses the Google Mobile Ads SDK to display banner advertisements. These ads help support the development of the app and keep it free. Google may use your device's advertising ID to serve personalized ads. You can manage your ad preferences in your device's Google settings. By using our app, you consent to the data practices of our advertising partners as described in their privacy policies.

### 4. Data Security

Since all your photos and associated location information are stored locally on your device, the security of that data is dependent on the security of your device itself. We do not have access to, nor can we retrieve, the photos you take.

### 5. Children's Privacy

Our App does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you believe that your child has provided this kind of information on our app, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
